# Session 13

**Date:** 2026-01-31

## Completed
- Confirmed per-run "checked" tracking for unchanged projects via snapshot metadata fields.

## Current Status
- GLM-1 schema now includes explicit fields to indicate a project was checked and unchanged.

## Files Changed
- `.issues/GLM-1/issue.md` - added snapshot metadata fields for unchanged checks.
- `.issues/GLM-1/plan.md` - added requirement to record check metadata.
- `.issues/GLM-1/summary-13.md` - session summary.

## Verification
- N/A (planning updates only).

## Next Steps
- Implement Drizzle schema/migrations with the new snapshot fields.

# Session 2

**Date:** 2026-01-31

## Completed
- Confirmed Drizzle supports raw SQL paths and bun:sqlite runtime usage.
- Flagged drizzle-kit driver selection caveats for SQLite migrations.

## Current Status
- Awaiting repo scaffold to migrate AI workflow assets and issue tracking.

## Files Changed
- `.issues/GLM-1/summary-2.md` - session summary.

## Verification
- N/A (guidance only).

## Next Steps
- User scaffolds `../gitlab-metrics/` with Bun; migrate workflow files and GLM-1 afterward.

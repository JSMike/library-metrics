# Session 9

**Date:** 2026-01-31

## Completed
- Locked in a run-scoped schema proposal with snapshot tables and resolved dependency view.

## Current Status
- GLM-1 now includes a concrete v1 schema aligned to historical reporting requirements.

## Files Changed
- `.issues/GLM-1/issue.md` - added v1 schema proposal.
- `.issues/GLM-1/summary-9.md` - session summary.

## Verification
- N/A (planning updates only).

## Next Steps
- Implement the schema in Drizzle (tables + migrations) and start ETL scaffolding.

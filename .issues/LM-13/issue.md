## Summary

Rename the project to "library-metrics" and update wording from dependency/dependencies to library/libraries across the app and routes.

## Requirements

- Rename the project to "library-metrics" in project metadata and documentation (user will handle remote rename).
- Change route paths and visible labels from dependencies to libraries.
- Keep "dependency" terminology only when referencing package.json/lockfile dependency types (dependencies/devDependencies/peerDependencies/optionalDependencies).
- Rename the SQLite filename default to "library-metrics".

## Open Questions

- None.

# LM-13 Plan

- Inventory current usage of "dependency"/"dependencies" and "gitlab-metrics" across UI, docs, routes, and config.
- Update routes and labels from dependencies to libraries while preserving dependency terms for npm dependency-type fields.
- Rename project metadata and SQLite filename to library-metrics (config/docs/package.json).
- Validate routes/links and adjust any copy-sensitive tests or snapshots.

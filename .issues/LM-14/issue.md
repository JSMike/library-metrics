## Summary

Rewrite `README.md` to clearly explain the project purpose, architecture, and how to get started/modify it, aimed at human readers (similar to AI-README but not AI-focused).

## Requirements

- Replace boilerplate README with a human-friendly explanation of the app’s purpose and use cases.
- Describe architecture and major technologies with links to key libraries/frameworks.
- Explain GitLab as current adapter and extensibility to other sources/downstream systems.
- Cover use cases: library adoption tracking, vulnerable/deprecated dependency discovery, and accountability workflows.
- Document the AI-WORKFLOW pattern and its extensibility to Jira/GitHub/GitLab issues via skills/MCP/commands.
- Provide clear getting started steps and guidance for making changes.

## Open Questions

- None.

# Session 4

**Date:** 2026-02-01

**Prompt/Ask:** Regenerate/update `src/routeTree.gen.ts`.

## Completed
- Attempted to regenerate the TanStack route tree via `bun --bun vite build`.
- Verified `src/routeTree.gen.ts` already includes the new dependencies and project routes.

## Current Status
- Route tree appears up to date with the new routes; no additional changes required.

## Plan Coverage
- Regeneration/verification step completed.

## Files Changed
- None in this session (route tree was already updated from prior changes).

## Verification
- Optional: rerun `bun --bun vite build` if you want to confirm build output locally.

## Next Steps
- Continue verification of the new UI flows if needed.

## Summary

Make the libraries table header cells (library and usage columns) buttons to enable sorting via the existing TanStack table sort handlers.

## Requirements

- Library and usage headers should be rendered as clickable buttons.
- Sorting behavior should remain unchanged; only header rendering/UX is updated.

## Open Questions

- None.

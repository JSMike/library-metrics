**Prompt/Ask:** Link Framework and Library columns in the framework overview report to the library detail page.

## Completed
- Added links for both Framework and Library columns using the report’s library key.

## Current Status

## Plan Coverage
- Step 3: template report UI updated.

## Files Changed

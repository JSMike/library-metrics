# Session 8

**Date:** 2026-02-05

**Prompt/Ask:** Confirm storing App Code on the project row and proceed with the updated parsing logic.

## Completed
- Kept the stored `app_code` approach (no query-time computation).
- Moved LM-43 back to review after confirming the direction.

## Current Status
- Review.

## Plan Coverage
- N/A (decision on storage strategy).

## Files Changed
- `.issues/LM-43/issue.md` - status to review.
- `.issues/index.md` - moved LM-43 to review.
- `.issues/LM-43/summary-8.md` - session summary.

## Verification
- Not run (not requested). Suggested: re-sync and validate App Code extraction with the updated pattern.

## Next Steps
- User verification and completion.

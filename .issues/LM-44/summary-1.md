# Session 1

**Prompt/Ask:** Copy AI workflow starter content into `../ai-workflow-starter` and create issue #1 with the original prompt.

## Completed
- Seeded `../ai-workflow-starter` with AI workflow docs, agent instructions, command docs, and a starter README.
- Created `.issues/` structure with `ISSUE-1` containing the original prompt and an index entry.

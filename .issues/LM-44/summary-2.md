# Session 2

**Date:** 2026-02-06

**Prompt/Ask:** Continue after an accidentally closed session and finish the update.

## Completed
- Verified `../ai-workflow-starter` exists and includes the copied starter files.
- Confirmed `ISSUE-1` captures the original prompt and content is generic.
- Updated LM-44 status from `in-progress` to `review`.
- Updated `.issues/index.md` to move LM-44 into the Review section.

## Current Status
- Ready for user verification.

## Plan Coverage
- Post-implementation workflow closeout completed.

## Files Changed
- `.issues/LM-44/issue.md` - set status to `review`.
- `.issues/index.md` - moved LM-44 from In Progress to Review.
- `.issues/LM-44/summary-2.md` - recorded resumed-session closeout.

## Verification
- Confirm LM-44 metadata status is `review` in `.issues/LM-44/issue.md`.
- Confirm LM-44 is listed under `### Review` in `.issues/index.md`.
- Confirm starter repo files remain present in `../ai-workflow-starter`.

## Next Steps
- User verifies starter repo contents; after confirmation, LM-44 can be moved from `review` to `done`.
